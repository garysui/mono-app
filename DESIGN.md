**Our Pricing**: 1.99% per transaction + $39/month per location (unlimited terminals)

### Target Market Strategy
**Phase 1**: Small independent restaurants (1-3 locations)
- Toast/Square are overkill and expensive for them
- Our BYOD approach saves $5K+ in hardware costs
- Local-first works great for small operations

**Phase 2**: Fast-casual chains (3-50 locations)  
- Multi-location management from day 1
- Franchise-friendly features
- Better margins than delivery-dependent businesses

**Phase 3**: Enterprise restaurant groups (50+ locations)

- Centralized procurement and operations
- Custom integration capabilities

### Sales & Marketing Attack Plan
**Against Toast**:
- "Save 50% on transaction fees"
- "No expensive hardware lock-in"
- "Works offline when Toast fails"

**Against Square**:
- "Real restaurant features, not retail POS adapted"
- "Built-in inventory and staff management"
- "Scales with your business growth"

**Against Legacy Systems**:
- "Modern technology your staff will actually enjoy using"
- "10x faster setup, 10x lower cost"
- "Cloud-based with local performance"

### Feature Release Strategy

**Annual AI Impact for Average Restaurant ($800K revenue):**
- Revenue increase: +$120K-200K
- Cost reduction: -$80K-120K
- Loss prevention: -$15K-25K  
- **Total Value: $215K-345K per year**
- **Platform ROI: 10-20x investment**

This AI advantage creates massive customer lock-in - once restaurants see $200K+ annual value from our AI, switching to competitors becomes financially impossible.

### Revenue Model (Beating Competition on Unit Economics)
**Transaction Processing**: 1.99% (vs Toast's 2.49% + $0.15)
- 10M transactions/month = $199K revenue (vs Toast's $264K)
- Still profitable due to lower infrastructure costs (local-first reduces server load)

**SaaS Subscription**: $39/month per location (vs Toast's $69/terminal)
- 1,000 restaurants = $39K MRR (vs limited features)
- Includes unlimited terminals, full feature set
